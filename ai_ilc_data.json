    "executiveSummary": [
      "The evolution of technology has profoundly shaped modern education, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. The Nation’s community colleges have a unique strength and ability to adopt and then incorporate emerging technologies in the teaching and learning process. Community colleges play a major role in developing the nations technical workforce.",
      "This project leverage the unique ability of community colleges to form Inter-disciplinary Learning Communities (ILCs) as collaborative educational environments where students and faculty from different academic disciplines come together to explore common themes, issues, and emerging technologies from multiple and different perspectives.",
      "This project integrates AI into the curriculum of STEM programs, focusing on two key aspects:",
      "<strong>1. AI as a Tool for Problem - Solving and Innovation:</strong> Our team is developing curricula that teach students how to use AI tools to solve real-world problems in their chosen fields. By teaching students to use AI as a tool, our team empowers them to drive innovation in their chosen professions.",
      "<strong>2. AI Literacy Across Disciplines:</strong> Our team ensures that AI education is not confined to specialized programs but is integrated into all STEM disciplines. This approach is creating a workforce where every individual, regardless of their field, has the skills to leverage AI's potential. This broad-based AI literacy will be critical for the future economy, where AI is expected to play a role in nearly every industry."
